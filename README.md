# About
This is the submission of Group 2 for Project 2 in CSCI 41.

# How to Use
## Step 1 | Accessing Site
Access the website through http://13.251.129.241:8069. Use the username "admin" and the password "password." This site will only be accessible until the submission of the project since there is a cost to running a server live.

## Step 2 | Accessing Abbyüêù
Click the upper right dropdown button and click "Abbyüêù" Do not click any other app. Note: When entering values in a field in the next steps, if the field has a bluish background, it is a required field.

## Step 3 | Customer Tab
Click the "Customer" tab and create a customer record. A customer is a person who sends a package. The customer ID will always be unique in the "Customer" tab.

## Step 4 | Service Tab
Click the "Service" tab and create a service record. A service specifies how a package is to be delivered. The service ID will always be unique in the "Service" tab.

## Step 5 | Delivery Staff Tab
Click the "Delivery Staff" tab and create a delivery staff record. A delivery staff delivers the package sent by a customer. The delivery staff ID will always be unique in the "Delivery Staff" tab.

## Step 6 | Recipient Tab
Click the "Recipient" tab and create a recipient record. A recipient receives the package sent by a customer. The recipient ID will always be unique in the "Recipient" tab.

## Step 7 | Package Tab
Click the "Package" tab and create a package record. A package is the object that is sent by the customer to the recipient. The control number will always be unique in the "Package" tab. Cost is a derived value - weight * 5. The formula for cost is simplified for the purposes of this project. If a field under the 'Receipt' section has a value, all fields must have a value. Note: Steps 3 to 6 can be accomplished through Step 7 via the dropdowns in the fields Customer, Service, Delivery Staff, and Recipient, respectively.
